						Brian Clarke is a British fashion designer, Creative Director, and Founder of the men’s fashion brand Brian Clarke. He has spent
						virtually his entire working life in the fashion industry – it’s in his blood. After a short spell at the London College of Fashion, he
						worked at Berman’s Nathan’s theatrical costumiers, honing his bespoke tailoring skills.
					</p>

					<p>But it was when he worked as an assistant designer/pattern cutter for Katherine Hamnett that a passion for fashion really got to him.</p>

					<p>
						After several years of hands-on experience, Brian eventually decided to go it alone. His first independent forays found him styling and
						designing clothes for pop videos for numerous bands, but an eye for a strong commercial presence was to reveal bigger ambitions.
					</p>

					<p>
						The store was more than just a shop; it rapidly became a social institution for elegant dressers from the worlds of film, music, art,
						and the city, all who were looking for the inimitable BC style. It was an instant winner and encouraged others to tap into Brian’s
						design talents. Deals from Japan notably Dep International – soon followed which persuaded him to close his shop and take on a new
						venture.
					</p>

					<p>
						Wind on five years and after a stint of property development, Brian Clarke returned with a fresh, compelling new autumn/winter menswear
						collection. In some ways he come full circle, employing the artistry of the bespoke skills he learned at the beginning in his stylish
						and subtle tailoring.
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						It takes a certain mastery to combine flamboyance with the understated, it’s no mean feat. But the artistry in Brian Clarke’s cutting
						can do just that, merging theatricality with tradition and the subtle. There’s a timeless quality about Clarke’s designs; they are
						inclusive and and covetable. But ultimately Brian’s collection aren’t just about standing out in the crowd, they make those wearing them
						feel confident and look great. More mastery in its own subtle way. British Menswear Guild
